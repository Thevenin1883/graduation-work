# College Acceptance Prediction AI

This repository contains a collection of scripts and resources related to predicting college acceptance using machine learning techniques. The project explores the use of TensorFlow for linear regression and other foundational steps in building a predictive AI model.

## Folder and File Descriptions

### 1. **tensor (College acceptance prediction AI)**
   - This folder contains the main scripts and resources for the College Acceptance Prediction AI project. Details of the implementation and results are located here.

### 2. **Start.txt**
   - A plain text file outlining the initial steps or notes for the project.

### 3. **tensor(first_step).py**
   - A Python script representing the first phase of the project. It likely includes basic setup, initial data preprocessing, and foundational model training steps.

### 4. **tensor(linear regression-footsize).py**
   - This script focuses on implementing a linear regression model using TensorFlow. The model might be related to predicting outcomes (e.g., acceptance chances) based on features like "footsize" or similar datasets.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Thevenin1883/College-Acceptance-AI.git
